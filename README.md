## 📖 About the Project
From **January 2025** to **June 2025**, I worked as a **Computer Science teacher** in a high school.  
I taught **C++** to second-year students (aged **15–16**).  
The course started from the basics and progressed through topics up to **arrays**.

This repository contains the exercises I assigned to my students during the year.  
They are **organized by topic** and arranged in **increasing order of difficulty**.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each topic folder contains:

- **`/Instruction`** – Exercise instructions (Italian 🇮🇹 and English 🇬🇧)
- **`/Solution`** – Solutions for all exercises
- **`/Code`** – Source files where students must implement their solutions
- **`/Tests`** – Automated tests to check the correctness of the implemented functions

> **Note:** For exercises that require implementing a function, **do not** change the function name or the number of parameters. This is necessary for the tests to work properly.

## 📝 Topics Covered

1. **Variables and Conditional Structures**
2. **Loops**
3. **Functions**
4. **Pointers** *(work in progress)*
5. **Arrays** *(work in progress)*

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoserMarco/CPP-Exercises.git
   cd cpp-exercises
   ```

2. **Open a topic folder** and read the instructions in `/Instruction`.

3. **Write your solution** in the corresponding `/Code` file.

4. **Run the tests** to verify your implementation.

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

To run the tests, make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`) and then:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 Tests/test_file.cpp -o test
./test
```

Replace `test_file.cpp` with the name of the test you want to run.
